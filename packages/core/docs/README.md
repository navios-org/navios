# Introduction

Navios us a framework for building Type-Safe Node.js servers. It uses TypeScript and Navios builder to generate a server with a specific structure. The framework is designed to be easy to use and understand, while also being powerful and flexible.

Under the hood, Navios makes use of [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) for the server implementation, and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation. This allows Navios to provide a type-safe experience while still being performant and easy to use.
